Flexia is an open-source library that provides a high-level API for developing Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for almost all kinds of tasks in a few lines of code. 

The main purpose of Flexia is to provide a comfortable interface, flexible functionality, and readable code, thereby allowing users to concentrate more attention and time on model development and its improvements respectively.

Flexia is mostly based on the PyTorch framework, but furthermore supports many useful functionalities from other libraries such as ü§óTransformers, bitsandbytes, etc.
